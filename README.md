# old-music-website
This is the code for a static website which I used as a music website for my music I created at the time (first half of 2021).
I wasn't very good at writing readable code at the time so this is a great example of how to write spaghetti code.
# Website preview
You can view the website here: https://linusced.github.io/old-music-website/
It was called evolvetrackaudio.com before i removed it from the internet.
Some of the features which originally were on the website have been removed but you can still listen to my music there and see the most impressive thing about the website: the audio events
You can find the web project I used to create these audio events with here: [audio-events](https://github.com/)
